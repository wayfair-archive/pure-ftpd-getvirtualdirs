Pure-FTPd Mysql based Virtual Directories
-----------------------------------------

We needed to have the ability to create "Symlink like" Virtual Directories in Pure-FTPd without allowing access to the entire file structure outside of the users FTP root.

An example Directory structure that we needed to simulate was:

What the FTP Client Sees -> What the actual filesystem is
/ftp_root/user1/         -> /ftp_root/user1/ 
/ftp_root/user1/incoming -> /nfs1/incoming/user1/
/ftp_root/user1/outgoing -> /nfs2/outgoing/user1/

Pure-FTPd has two features that made adding our feature a much easier task.
It has the ability to enable a Fake/Virtual Chroot, which in simple terms allows access outside of the normal chroot, but without the user knowing it so that symlinks are accessible.
The other feature that it has is the ability to use MySQL as a backend for storing/managing user accounts.

Our patches allow you to create a MySQL table that stores an alias to real file path mapping. 
This allows us to manage these Virtual Directories via our standard MySQL integration.
 
These patches are in the standard FreeBSD port format and can easily be compiled into Pure-FTPd on any current FreeBSD machine by adding the files in the 
/usr/ports/ftp/pure-ftpd/files/ directory.

Inorder to make use of the functionality you need to enable both of the following settings:
MYSQL=on "Support for users in MySQL database"
VIRTUALCHROOT=on (default) "Follow symlinks outside a chroot jail" 

Once that is done its as simple as adding a MySQL table with three columns
User,Virtual_Name,Virtual_Base

An example query is provided as a patch to the pureftpd-mysql.conf
